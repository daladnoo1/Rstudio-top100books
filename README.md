This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of top-selling books on the Amazon
platform from 2009 to 2021 using the R programming language and relevant data
analysis libraries. The dataset encompasses various characteristics of books, such as
prices, ratings, number of reviews, publication year, and more. The goal of the project
is to identify patterns and trends in the book industry through data visualization. The
subsequent sections provide a detailed exploration of the dataset, accompanied by
insightful interpretations of each visualization.
